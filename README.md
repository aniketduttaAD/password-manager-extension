openPasswordManager

Made a simple password manager extension with basic HTML5, CSS and Javascript. 
For storing the data for now i am using chrome local storage which stores all the data on your device. 
In the further commits i would be adding functionalities as email verification adding of new passwords and storing new passwords automatically when you log into any websites. 

Its a basic college assignment, Thank you,
Have fun.
